# GitFit
GitFit by Jessica Marc Raffa Yssabel

## Project Description
<p>Welcome to GitFit! Your newest fitness tracker! On our site you can create a profile with your age, height, and weight and try one of two things, the BMI Calculator, or our Weight Logger. When you use our Weight Logger, it will create a user profile in our database with the information you provided and a graph based on that data (using chart.js). There will also be inputs for you to log/edit/delete other dates and weights and the chart will update accordingly. </p>

Look at it in action! https://gitfit-jessyrama.herokuapp.com/
